## Description

ToDo list is a Todo App that allows users to see, add, edit, and remove todos. Other than that it implements the following rules:

- Alongside each Todo, it has a button with the text “Mark as completed”. When this button is clicked, there is a strike through the text of the todo.
- Instead of a button, button is refactored so that the todo itself can be clicked to mark it as completed. It also adds a strikethrough style to the Todo if it is completed. A user can toggle it on and off by clicking.
- It adds some styling to your application - a CSS animation that fades out a Todo when it is deleted
- Saves your todos in localStorage and retrieve them when the page loads.
